A modular machine learning & remote sensing framework for mapping shrub cover in arid and semi‚Äëarid ecosystems.

---

## üìñ Overview

Shrub cover is a critical component of arid and semi‚Äëarid ecosystems, significantly influencing **biodiversity**, **soil stability**, and **carbon storage**. However, accurately mapping **Shrub Fractional Abundance (SFA)** over large areas remains a major challenge.

This project presents a novel, two‚Äëstage workflow to address this:
1.  **Fine‚Äëscale shrub crown segmentation** from very high-resolution (VHR) imagery.
2.  **Regional upscaling of SFA** using Sentinel‚Äë2 satellite time series and machine learning.

The repository is designed to be **modular**‚Äîeach stage resides in its own subfolder with dedicated scripts and documentation, allowing you to run them independently or as an integrated pipeline.

### Subfolder Summaries

*   **`crown_segmentation/`**: High‚ÄëResolution Shrub Crown Segmentation using **DINOv2 & CNN**. Processes VHR imagery (~0.5‚ÄØm) to generate binary shrub crown masks.
*   **`upscaling/`**: Regional Upscaling of Shrub Fractional Abundance. Leverages crown segmentation results and **Sentinel‚Äë2 phenology variables** to predict continuous SFA at 20‚ÄØm resolution using **XGBoost**.

---

## üîÑ Workflow

### Step 1 ‚Äî Crown Segmentation
*   **Input**: VHR imagery (from Google Earth Pro, UAVs, or commercial providers)
*   **Process**: Feature extraction (DINOv2), CNN model training, semantic segmentation of shrub crowns.
*   **Output**: Binary raster maps of shrub crowns.

### Step 2 ‚Äî Upscaling
*   **Input**: Sentinel‚Äë2 imagery time series + crown segmentation maps from Step 1.
*   **Process**: Extraction of seasonal vegetation indices, XGBoost regression modeling, and model interpretability with SHAP.
*   **Output**: Large‚Äëscale, continuous maps of Shrub Fractional Abundance (SFA).

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get up and running with the pipeline in a few steps.

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shrub-sfa-mapping.git
    cd shrub-sfa-mapping
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the pipeline**
    *   **Option A (Modular)**: Run only Step 1 or Step 2. See the detailed `README.md` in each subfolder.
    *   **Option B (Full Pipeline)**:
    ```bash
    # Run Crown Segmentation
    cd crown_segmentation
    python src/train_segmentation.py
    python src/predict_crowns.py

    # Run Upscaling
    cd ../upscaling
    python src/extract_features.py
    python src/train_upscaling.py
    python src/predict_sfa.py
    ```
